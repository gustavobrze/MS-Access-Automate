# MS-Access-Automate

This small project was developed following a demand to automate Microsoft Access databases in my former company,
i was responsible for grant access to the users in the databases and was a very repetitive and boring task, so instead of copying the lines
manually, i created a script with an user interface in which the user insert his name, his SAP ID and the ID of the user whose he wants to copy the permissions,
so, through a SQL manipulation using pyodbc library, the mirror user permissions are copied to the user profile with one button click.
